# Xperience 13 inline editable areas
> Editable areas in the Xperience 13 CMS that can be inserted into regular rich text fields.

This repository contains the code and other assets for a proof-of-concept project to add inline editable areas to rich text fields in the Kentico Xperience CMS. It accompanies a blog post about the project, which goes into further detail into how it works, and what choices we made during development.

If you want to try out this functionality for yourself, you will need access to an Xperience 13 instance. Earlier versions of the CMS should work as well, but will require some additional tweaking. To add the functionality to your instance, you will have to copy the files from the `src` folder into your Xperience instance folder. You will have to tweak some of the folder names and the like to match your environment. This should be pretty straightforward, but you can always refer to the blog post for additional information should you run into any trouble.

One final note is that the functionality was developed as a proof-of-concept, and thus may not be production-ready in its current state. Should you choose to use any of it, it's up to you to make sure it suits your purposes and that everything is working as it should.

Enjoy!
